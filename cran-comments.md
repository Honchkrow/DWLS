## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

* checking installed package size ... NOTE
    installed size is 80.2Mb
    sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
      data  80.0Mb

There was one note about the size of the files in the /data. I know there 
are (at times) exceptions that are made. I am hopeful that one can be made in 
this case as the data is single-cell gene expression data along with labels/
bulk data in order for the user to see a best real-world example.
