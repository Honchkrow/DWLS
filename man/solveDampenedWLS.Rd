\description{
Dampened weighted least squares (DLWS) is an estimation
method for gene expression deconvolution, in which the cell-type
composition of a bulk RNA-seq data set is computationally inferred.
This method corrects common biases towards cell types that are
characterized by highly expressed genes and/or are highly prevalent,
to provide accurate detection across diverse cell types. To begin,
the user must input a bulk RNA-seq data set, along with a labeled
representative single-cell RNA-seq data set that will serve to generate
cell-type-specific gene expression profiles. Ideally, the single-cell
data set will contain cells from all cell types that may be found in the
bulk data. DWLS will return the cell-type composition of the bulk data.
First, solve OLS then use the solution to find a starting point for the
weights. Next, the dampened weighted least squares is performed. The weights
are iterated until convergence then the dampening constant for weights is
found using cross-validation (with decreasing step size for convergence).

Note: The function uses solveDampenedWLSj() and findDampeningConstant().
