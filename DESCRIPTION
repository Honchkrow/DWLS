Description: The rapid development of single-cell transcriptomic technologies 
    has helped uncover the cellular heterogeneity within cell populations. 
    However, bulk RNA-seq continues to be the main workhorse for quantifying 
    gene expression levels due to technical simplicity and low cost. 
    To most effectively extract information from bulk data given the new 
    knowledge gained from single-cell methods, we have developed a novel 
    algorithm to estimate the cell-type composition of bulk data from a 
    single-cell RNA-seq-derived cell-type signature. Comparison with existing 
    methods using various real RNA-seq data sets indicates that our new 
    approach is more accurate and comprehensive than previous methods, 
    especially for the estimation of rare cell types. More importantly,
    our method can detect cell-type composition changes in response to external 
    perturbations, thereby providing a valuable, cost-effective method for 
    dissecting the cell-type-specific effects of drug treatments or condition 
    changes. As such, our method is applicable to a wide range of biological 
    and clinical investigations. Dampened weighted least squares ('DWLS') is 
    an estimation method for gene expression deconvolution, in which 
    the cell-type composition of a bulk RNA-seq data set is computationally 
    inferred. This method corrects common biases towards cell types that are 
    characterized by highly expressed genes and/or are highly prevalent, to 
    provide accurate detection across diverse cell types. See:

    information about the development of 'DWLS' and the methods behind our 
    functions.
