Description: Dampened weighted least squares (DWLS) is an estimation method 
    for gene expression deconvolution, in which the cell-type composition 
    of a bulk RNA-seq data set is computationally inferred. This method 
    corrects common biases towards cell types that are characterized 
    by highly expressed genes and/or are highly prevalent, to provide 
    accurate detection across diverse cell types. To begin, the user 
    must input a bulk RNA-seq data set, along with a labeled representative 
    single-cell RNA-seq data set that will serve to generate cell-type-specific 
    gene expression profiles. Ideally, the single-cell data set will contain 
    cells from all cell types that may be found in the bulk data. DWLS will 
    return the cell-type composition of the bulk data.
